{"name":"Joboman.github.io","tagline":"","body":"# Bibbler \r\n## (Or, Scrabble-Boggle-Bejeweled)\r\nThis game was initially conceived by Lilly, DC, Vera, and myself, after we got bored of playing regular scrabble. A few weeks later, after the success of 2048, I decided to put it into motion with this game. With that being said, all the CSS magic is shamelessly stolen from [2048](http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/). Play my game. Tell me what you think of it. Yes, there are a lot of bugs (I will be working to fix as many as I can). In the meantime, enjoy!\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
